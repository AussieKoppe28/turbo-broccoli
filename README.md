Small infosec Projects I have done
Inside this  repositorty I have created 3 different ethical hacking Python scripts or code to be used in a safe working enviroment.

The first one is an IP Scanner pretty simple to use code here. I ended up changing the variables to look for websites. However, you have the option to scan for IP addresses as well.

Next, I created a Vuln Scanner, which starts by looking for open ports from 1-500 inputs for looking up vulnerable ports and vulnerable software are included in the scan. This code, I think, is pretty cool because it works in context with my port scanner script. Vuln scanner targets the addresses from the port scanner, stripping down to the file of your target machine/port and injecting the file with the Vuln scanner allowing it to open on random port #.

The last code I have is the portscanner which allows you to scan for open ports in a server. It scans for all vulnerabilities for exploitation.
